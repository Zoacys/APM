# On Accurate Prediction of Cloud Workloads with Adaptive Pattern Mining

## Abstract

Resource provisioning for cloud computing requires adaptive and accurate prediction of cloud workloads. However, existing studies have faced significant challenges in predicting time-varying cloud workloads of diverse trends and patterns, and the lack of accurate prediction often results in resource waste and violation of service-level agreements (SLAs). We propose a bagging-like ensemble framework for cloud workload prediction with Adaptive Pattern Mining (APM). Within this framework, we first design a two-step method with various models to simultaneously capture the ''low frequency'' and ''high frequency'' characteristics of highly variable workloads. For a given workload, we further develop an error-based weights aggregation method to integrate the prediction results from multiple pattern-specific models into a final result to predict a future workload. We conduct experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of APM in workload prediction with various prediction lengths using two real-world workload traces from Google and Alibaba cloud data centers, which are of different types. Extensive experimental results show that APM achieves superior prediction accuracy over several classic and state-of-the-art workload prediction methods for highly variable real-world cloud workloads.
