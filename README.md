# Accurate Cloud Workload Prediction with Adaptive Pattern Mining

## Abstract

Resource provisioning for cloud computing requires adaptive and accurate prediction of cloud workloads. However, existing studies fail to predict time-varying cloud workloads of diverse trends and patterns, often resulting in resource waste and violation of service-level agreements (SLAs). To address this critical challenge, we propose a bagging-like ensemble framework for cloud workload prediction with Adaptive Pattern Mining (APM). Within this framework, we first design a two-step method with multiple models to simultaneously capture the ''low frequency'' and ''high frequency'' characteristics of highly variable workloads. We further develop an error-based weights aggregating method for a given workload to integrate the prediction results from multiple pattern-dedicated models into a final result to predict a future workload. We conduct workload prediction experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of APM using two real-world workload traces from Google and Alibaba cloud data centers, which are of different types with various prediction lengths. Extensive experimental results show that APM achieves superior prediction accuracy than the classic and state-of-the-art workload prediction methods for highly variable real-world cloud workloads.
